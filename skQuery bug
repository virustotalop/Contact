Hi!

i see you work on skQuery.

Thanks for that!

i found a Bug with SQL

My Script:

command /mobsave:
	trigger:
		set {_mobs::*} to result of query "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `mob-save`"
		send "%{_mobs::*}%" to the player
#		set {_mobs::*} to result of query "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `mob-save` WHERE `uuid`='%uuid of player%'"
		loop {_mobs::*}:
			send "%loop-value-1%" to the player
			send "%loop-value-2%" to the player
			send "%loop-value-3%" to the player
			
I have no errors on reload or console

the command on minecraft give this back:

com.sun.rowset.CachedRowSetImpl@300e353c
com.sun.rowset.CachedRowSetImpl@300e353c
-2
-3

SQL Query (direct on phpmyadmin or php) give back:
62

is this a bug from skQuery or from Skript?

greetings and sorry for my very bad english.
